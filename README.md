#C-BAS: Certificate-based AAA for SDN Experimental Facilities

##Description
C-BAS is a certificate-based AAA architecture for SDN experimental facilities, which is by design both secure and flexible. We are developing C-BAS as a robust AAA infrastructure solution to identify experimenters, police their actions based on the associated roles, facilitate secure resource sharing, and provide for detailed accountability.

##Wiki
Please refer to [wiki section](https://github.com/EICT/C-BAS/wiki) for installation and usage instructions.

##Publications
Interested readers should consider reviewing the following papers, which overview C-BAS architecture and implementation as well as presents a migration path for its introduction in larger scale in SDN experimental facilities.
