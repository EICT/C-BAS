#C-BAS: Certificate-based AAA for SDN Experimental Facilities

##Description
C-BAS is a certificate-based AAA architecture for SDN experimental facilities, which is by design both secure and flexible. We are developing C-BAS as a robust AAA infrastructure solution to identify experimenters, police their actions based on the associated roles, facilitate secure resource sharing, and provide for detailed accountability.

C-BAS takes advantage and consolidates the know-how from several years of experience in SDN testbed development.

##Publications
Interested readers should consider reviewing the following paper, which overviews C-BAS and presents a migration path for its introduction in larger scale in SDN experimentatl facilities.
