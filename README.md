#C-BAS: Certificate-based AAA for SDN Experimental Facilities

##Description
C-BAS is a certificate-based AAA architecture for SDN experimental facilities, which is by design both secure and flexible. We aim to develop C-BAS as a robust AAA infrastructure to identify experimenters, police their actions based on the associated roles, facilitate secure resource sharing, and provide for detailed accountability. 

C-BAS is a certificate-based AAA architecture for SDN experimental facilities, which is by design both secure and
flexible. It incoroprates several sub-frameworks such

- [OCF](https://github.com/fp7-ofelia/ocf) 

The C-BAS directory contains local copies from OHouse and OCF, with several extensions.
