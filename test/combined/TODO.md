- Registry is not reporting_ 100 errors, instead gives an attribute error; fails silently
- Possible to create identical objects in some cases; is this correct behaviour?
- Test required objects are at least implemented
- Check slice naming logic
- Check expiry logic
- Comments and docs
- Quickstart in README.md
- Update CI config
- Check authorisation policies

GENI documentation:

– No 'update' annotation for 'member' object, but method allowed
– No description of 'options' during delete operation
– urn:publicid+IDN+this_sa+project+myproject typo
